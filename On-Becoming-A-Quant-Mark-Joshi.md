# 6. How much do I need to know?

- Depends from place to place, role to role

- Also important to show general interest in the field
    - Should read the Economist, the Financial Times, and/or the WSJ
- It's not unusual to ask basic calculus or statistics questions in an interview
    - E.g. what is the integral of log(x)?
- Also common: asking for a derivation of Black-Scholes
- Have a 60 second speech prepared for each line on your resume

____
# 7. What are the do's and don'ts of interviewing?

## Do's
- Eat a solid meal beforehand
